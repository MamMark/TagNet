	* tagfuse/tagfuse/tagfuseargs.py:
	when tagfuse is installed as develop (in place), rather than as a
	full install, global_args (an argparse namespace) doesn't get
	initialized.  For some reason process_cmd_args() isn't getting called.

	Add code in get_cmd_args() to check global_args and if None then force
	process_cmd_args() to get called which will process any arguments
	and set up global_args appropriately.
