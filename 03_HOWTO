See 00_Install for installation instructions.

1) Connect a Base Station to wifi network.
   (previously not connected to this network)

   o plug the base station in and power it up.
   o look for the local wifi network 'comitup-<nnnn>'
   o connect to this network.
   o browse to 'http://comitup-nnnn.local
   o select an available wifi net and click 'connect'.


2) Render MD (markdown) files (Grip)

  pip  install grip   (python systems)
  brew install grip   (Mac OS X)

  from github:
    git clone https://github.com/MamMark/grip.git
    cd grip
    sudo python setup.py install


  Using grip:

    grip <markdownfile>
    grip --pass=<token> <markdownfile>
    * Running on http://localhost:6419/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

    point a browser at http://localhost:6419/ to see your rendered doc.

  - you may run into the API rate limit in which case you should
    use a github personal access token.  You need a github login.

  see https://github.com/MamMark/grip#access
  see github, Settings->Developer settings->Personal access tokens

3) Remote mounting file systems.

   sshfs is used to perform the mount via a ssh tunnel.  One should set up ssh keys
   and an authorized user prior to mounting.  This will greatly simplify operation.

   rmt is the remote host whose file system we want to mount
   rmt user: xyz


   Linux -> Linux:

     sudo apt-get install sshfs
     sudo mkdir /mnt/rmt/<dir>
     sudo sshfs -o allow_other xyz@rmt:<remote_dir> /mnt/rmt/<dir>


   Linux -> MacOS:

   Filesystems on MacOS are typically case-insensitive.  ie. a file named Abcd
   is the same file as abcd.  Just be aware.
